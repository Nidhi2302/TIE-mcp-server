# TIE MCP Server

Welcome to the Technique Inference Engine (TIE) MCP Server documentation.

## Overview

The TIE MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides advanced MITRE ATT&CK technique prediction and analysis capabilities. It leverages machine learning to predict likely attack techniques based on observed patterns.

## Key Features

- **Technique Prediction**: Predict likely MITRE ATT&CK techniques based on observed attack patterns
- **Real-time Analysis**: Process threat intelligence data in real-time
- **Machine Learning**: Advanced ML models for accurate predictions
- **MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with MCP-compatible clients
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy customization

## Quick Start

To get started with the TIE MCP Server, see the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide.

## Architecture

The TIE MCP Server consists of several key components:

- **MCP Server**: Handles client communications and protocol implementation
- **TIE Engine**: Core machine learning engine for technique prediction
- **Model Manager**: Manages trained models and their lifecycle
- **Database**: Stores models, metrics, and metadata
- **Monitoring**: Tracks performance and system health
